TEALS Minecraft Project
=======================

The TEALS Minecraft project is a set of lessons based on the Minecraft Forge
<http://www.minecraftforge.net/> modding package. We have customized this
package to reduce the amount of overhead of modifying Minecraft, so that
students can easily create new kinds of items, blocks, and entities in a custom
Minecraft client.

Currently, our package supports the IntelliJ and Eclipse Java IDEs. Start off by
unzipping the archive (Eclipse or IDEA flavor) into a working directory on your
machine.


Eclipse
-------

    For the Eclipse package, open the root of the project as a new workspace (it
    should be named 'TealsMC-Eclipse'). You should be ready to go. Just hit the
    run button (or Ctrl-F11 or F11) and the Minecraft client splash screen
    should come up after a few seconds. Follow the instructions from Lab 1 to
    start modding.


IntelliJ IDEA
-------------

    At the IntelliJ IDEA splash screen, hit "Open", and select the "Forge"
    directory in your working directory. You *may* see a warning about an
    improperly set up JDK for your project. Assuming you have installed a JDK,
    IntelliJ should automatically walk you through the steps needed to fix this.
    After that, run the project and you should see the Minecraft client splash
    screen after several seconds.


Lessons and Labs
----------------
    You can find the TEALS Minecraft lessons and labs on the project web site at
    http://tealsk12.github.io/tealsMC/ (case sensitive).
